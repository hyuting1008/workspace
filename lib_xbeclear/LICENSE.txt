In the event of such finding of invalidity or unenforceability, the parties will substitute forthwith the invalid, or unenforceable provision(s) by such effective provision(s) as will most closely correspond with the original intention of the provision(s) so voided. No delay or failure of either party to enforce any right or provision under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right or of or any other right under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (a) XMOS may only carry out such an audit once in any 12-month period during the term of this Agreement, (b) such audit shall be limited to only such documentation as is reasonably related to Licensee’s compliance with this Agreement.
