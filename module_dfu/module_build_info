# This file describes how this module will affect the application
# using it. The file is included in the Makefile of the main application.
#
# The module contributes to the build of the application by extending 
# the following variables:
#
#   SOURCE_DIRS  - directories with source files to be included in the build
#   INCLUDE_DIRS - directories to be added to the include path during the build 
#   LIB_DIRS     - directories containing libraries to be linked into the build
#
# Note that all the source files in each directory in SOURCE_DIRS 
# will be compiled (you do not need to name the files individually).
#
